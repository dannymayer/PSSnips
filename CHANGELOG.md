# Changelog

All notable changes to [PSSnips](https://github.com/dannymayer/PSSnips) are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-20

### Added

- **`Add-SnipTerminalProfile [-Keybinding <string>] [-Font <string>] [-Path <string>] [-Force] [-WhatIf]`** —
  injects a PSSnips TUI profile, a custom colour scheme (Catppuccin Mocha-inspired
  dark theme), and an optional keybinding (`Ctrl+Alt+S` by default) into Windows
  Terminal's `settings.json`. Auto-detects Stable, Preview, and unpackaged
  installs. Idempotent: warns on re-run unless `-Force` is passed. Fully
  `-WhatIf` / `-Confirm` compatible.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-20

### Added

- **`Get-StaleSnip [-DaysUnused <int>] [-IncludeNeverRun]`** — lists snippets
  not run in N days (default 90). Displays `DaysIdle` column; never-run
  snippets shown as `∞` with `-IncludeNeverRun`.
- **`Get-SnipStats [-Top <int>] [-SortBy RunCount|LastRun|Name] [-All]`** —
  execution leaderboard aggregated from index `runCount` / `lastRun` metadata.
- **`Export-VSCodeSnips [-Language <ext>] [-OutputDir <path>] [-WhatIf]`** —
  exports the snippet collection to VS Code user snippets JSON format
  (`$env:APPDATA\Code\User\snippets\<lang>.json`). Merges with existing files.
  Auto-detects VS Code Stable and Insiders installs.
- **`Invoke-FuzzySnip [-Action Show|Run|Edit] [-Filter <string>]`** — fuzzy
  snippet picker via `fzf` with in-terminal preview. Falls back to `PSFzf`'s
  `Invoke-Fzf` if raw fzf is unavailable, or to `Get-Snip` if neither is
  installed.

### Performance

- **Module-level index/config cache** — `LoadIdx` and `LoadCfg` return a
  cached in-memory hashtable on repeat calls; dirty flag cleared on every
  `SaveIdx`/`SaveCfg`; reduces per-operation I/O by ~90%.
- **Argument completer TTL cache** — snippet name completions are cached for
  10 seconds and invalidated immediately on any write, eliminating a full
  index deserialise on every `<TAB>` press.
- **TUI single-load optimisation** — `Start-SnipManager` loads the index once
  at startup; `Get-Filtered` uses the in-memory copy; index refreshed only
  after write actions (`n`, `e`, `d`, `g`).
- **Full-text search sidecar cache (`fts-cache.json`)** — `Get-Snip -Content`
  now queries an in-memory FTS index rebuilt on each save instead of reading
  every snippet file from disk. Cache file excluded from git via `.gitignore`.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **File locking on `index.json` and `config.json`** — `SaveIdx` and `SaveCfg`
  now acquire an advisory `.lock` file (with 3 s timeout) and write via a
  temp-file → atomic rename, eliminating silent data loss when two sessions
  write concurrently. Same protection applied to `shared-index.json` in
  `Publish-Snip`. Stale `.lock` files are cleaned up on module load.
- **Token security warning** — `Set-SnipConfig -GitHubToken` / `-GitLabToken`
  now emits `Write-Warning` directing users to environment variables instead of
  plain-text storage. New `-SecureStorage` switch encrypts the token with
  Windows DPAPI (`ConvertFrom-SecureString`) and stores it under a `*Secure`
  key; token resolution priority is `$env:` → DPAPI → plain-text.
- **`Get-SnipConfig` token masking** — stored tokens are now displayed as
  `[plain-text]` or `[DPAPI encrypted]` instead of the raw value.
- **`$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` removed from module scope** — setting
  this at module scope could affect the caller's session; per-function
  `try/catch` and `-ErrorAction` flags are sufficient.
- **Test isolation** — `PSSnips.Tests.ps1` no longer directly mutates
  `$script:Defaults['SnippetsDir']`; the test `BeforeAll` now pre-seeds
  `config.json` so `script:InitEnv` picks up the temp path via `LoadCfg`.

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **PowerShell minimum version** declared as 7.0; drops PS 5.1 support
  (`PowerShellVersion = '7.0'`, `CompatiblePSEditions = @('Core')`).
- **Unicode encoding fix** in CI workflow files to ensure consistent UTF-8
  output on Windows runners.
- **PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1** added to repository to enforce consistent
  static analysis rules across local and CI runs.
- **SupportsShouldProcess** (`-WhatIf` / `-Confirm`) added to `Set-SnipConfig`,
  `New-Snip`, `Set-SnipTag`, and `Start-SnipManager`.
- **Private TUI helper functions** renamed from unapproved verbs to approved
  verbs: `Draw-List` → `Write-SnipList`, `Draw-Detail` → `Write-SnipDetail`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-01-01

### Added

#### Core Snippet Management
- `New-Snip` — Create a named snippet and open it in the configured editor
- `Add-Snip` — Import a snippet from a file path, clipboard, or pipeline string
- `Show-Snip` — Display snippet content with syntax-highlighted output
- `Get-Snip` — List and search snippets by name, description, tag, or content
- `Edit-Snip` — Open an existing snippet in the configured editor

- Run history tracking (`runCount`, `lastRun`) with sortable listings via `Get-Snip -Sort`
- Snippet versioning: `Get-SnipHistory` to view past versions, `Restore-Snip` to roll back
- Template variable substitution using `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax (prompts at run time)
- Snippet chaining via `Invoke-Snip -Pipeline` to pass output to the next snippet
- PSScriptAnalyzer lint integration via `Test-Snip`
- SHA-256 duplicate detection prevents accidental re-import of identical content
